Level 2 access: /createroom /whois
Level 3 access: /boot
Level 4 access: /ip (/forcejoin /fj) /mute /closeroom /staffchat? /ninja
Level 5 access: /permit

 perhaps a ban function. a server restart would purge a ban list though.




 // User status work.
    1 - 5?

    1: Guest            > Has limited access. Perhaps no access to any commands? Maybe not.
    2: User             > Has access to specific commands for quality of life stuff (/msg /reply etc)
    3: Room Host?       > Perhaps the adition of /createroom will require this status.
                            Would have the ability to moderate that channel via /boot command perhaps.
                            Maybe a way to modify the rooms info or something. Not sure yet.
    4: Moderator        > Would have access to abilities suitable for dealing with the userbase.
                            IE: /kick /ban /users /ip?
    5: Administrator    > Highest level of access. Access to all available features plus some.
                            and perhaps the ability to temporarily revoke access of a moderator
                            if need be. Since moderators are hard-coded, being able to temp remove
                            access may be required.
